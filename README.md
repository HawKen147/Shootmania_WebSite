# Shootmania_WebSite
Here is a project for the Shootmania community.
The websote will be available soon on the World Wide Web.
But you can still try in on gitpod

## How to test the project on gitpod ?

First, click on the button below

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HawKen147/Shootmania_WebSite)

Once you're in visual studio, the image will build itself and you will have to give the authorization to open pop up (say yes).
After that you should be on the index.php page

Create an account and login with the account you have created
There is other players and teams that are already created. 
- player1
- player2
- player3
- player4
- player5
- test

For each user theire password are the same as theire name (for exemple : login test PW test).

## What can you do by now ?
You can create an account, sign in, create tournaments, create teams, start tournament, end tournament, add players and team to that tournament...

To start a tournament you will need to create a team and register with your team and the players in your team.
Its better if you create a tournament that requires only one person to play so you don't have to create other players.
Also you can create players / teams directly in the database using root / MY_SQL_PASSWORD (you can find it in the docker-compose.yml file).
