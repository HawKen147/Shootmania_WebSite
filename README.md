# Shootmania_WebSite
Here is a project for the Shootmania community
You can find and try on this website http://shootmaniatournament.mywebcommunity.org/
Or you can try it in gitpod

## How to test the project on gitpod ?

First, click on the button below

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HawKen147/Shootmania_WebSite)

Once you're in visual studio, the image will build itself and you will have to give the authorization to open pop up (say yes).
Then you will have a 403 forbidden (because the path of the website is not specified)
click in the URL and add at the end : /view

After that you should be on the index.php page

Create an account and login with the account you have created

## What can you do by now ?
You can create an account, sign in, create tournaments, create teams, start tournament, end tournament...

To start a tournament you will need to create a team and register with your team and the players in your team.
Its better if you create a tournament that requires only one person to play so you don't have to create other players.
Also you can create players / teams directly in the database using root / MY_SQL_PASSWORD (you can find it in the docker-compose.yml file.
