## How to test the project ?

First, click on the button below

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HawKen147/Shootmania_WebSite)

Once you're in visual studio, the image will build itself and you will have to give the authorization to open pop up (say yes).
Then you will have a 403 forbidden (because the path of the website is not specified)
click in the URL and add at the end : /view

After that you should be on the index.php page
