# Shootmania_WebSite
A little project for the ShootMania community

## How to test the project ?

First, click on the button below

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HawKen147/Shootmania_WebSite)

Once you're in visual studio, the image will build itself and you will have to give the authorization to open pop up (say yes).
Then you will have a 403 forbidden (because the path of the website is not specified)
click in the URL and add at the end : /view

After that you should be on the index.php page

Create an account and login with the account you have created

Every thing's working exept the password recovery because there is no smtp server by now
